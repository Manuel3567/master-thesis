    "# Workflow of the `evaluate_model` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Function Definition and Parameters**\n",
    "The function `evaluate_model` takes in the following parameters:\n",
    "- `entsoe`: A DataFrame containing power data\n",
    "- `target_column`: Column name containing the target variable (default: 'power')\n",
    "- `dist`: Probability distribution (default: LogNormal)\n",
    "- `case`: Integer determining feature selection and loss function\n",
    "- `n_estimators`: Number of boosting iterations (default: 100)\n",
    "- `learning_rate`: Learning rate for the NGBoost model (default: 0.03)\n",
    "- `random_state`: Random seed (default: 42)\n",
    "- `output_file`: File path for saving results\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Preprocessing the Data**\n",
    "- **Scaling the Power Data**:\n",
    "  - The maximum power value is identified and rounded up to the nearest 1000.\n",
    "  - The target variable (`power`) is normalized using this max value plus a small epsilon to avoid division by zero.\n",
    "  - A new feature, `power_t-96`, is created by shifting the target column by 96 time steps.\n",
    "  - A time-based interval index (`interval_index`) is computed to segment the data into 15-minute intervals.\n",
    "  - Any rows containing NaN values are dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Train-Validation-Test Split**\n",
    "   - Split the dataset into three subsets:  \n",
    "     - **Train**: Data from 2016â€“2022.  \n",
    "     - **Validation**: Data from 2023.  \n",
    "     - **Test**: Data from 2024.  \n",
    "     \n",
    "## 4. **Feature Selection Based on Case Parameter**\n",
    "Different cases dictate which features are included and which loss function is used:\n",
    "- Cases 1-10 select different combinations of power history (`power_t-96`) and wind speed data at different heights (`ws_10m_loc`, `ws_100m_loc`).\n",
    "- Loss functions used: `CRPScore` or `LogScore`.\n",
    "- Output file paths are dynamically updated based on the selected case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Extract Training and Validation Data**\n",
    "- Feature columns and target values are extracted for training and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Initialize and Train NGBoost Model**\n",
    "- `NGBRegressor` is instantiated with:\n",
    "  - Distribution: `dist` (e.g., LogNormal)\n",
    "  - Loss function: Chosen based on case\n",
    "  - `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, and `random_state`\n",
    "- The model is trained using `model.fit()` with validation data included.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "- **Interval-Based Scoring**:\n",
    "  - Validation data is split into 96 sub-arrays, corresponding to 96 time intervals per day.\n",
    "  - The model's score is computed separately for each interval and overall.\n",
    "- **Predictions**:\n",
    "  - `y_val_pred`: Point predictions.\n",
    "  - `y_val_dists`: Predicted probability distributions.\n",
    "- **Compute CRPS and NLL**:\n",
    "  - Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) are computed for each sample.\n",
    "  - CRPS is calculated for both Gaussian and log-normal distributions.\n",
    "  - Scores are stored in lists for later aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. **Compute Per-Interval Statistics**\n",
    "- For each of the 96 intervals:\n",
    "  - Mean, min, and max CRPS (Gaussian and log-normal) are computed.\n",
    "  - Mean, min, and max NLL are computed.\n",
    "  - Results are stored in dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. **Store Results in DataFrames**\n",
    "- **`results_per_time_interval_df`**: Stores per-interval CRPS, NLL, and model scores.\n",
    "- **`results_summary_stats_df`**: Stores overall summary statistics (means, min, max for CRPS, NLL, and model scores).\n",
    "- **`results_per_row_df`**: Stores per-sample CRPS and NLL values.\n",
    "- **`hyperparameters_df`**: Stores model hyperparameters and dataset details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. **Save Results to Excel**\n",
    "- An Excel file is created with multiple sheets:\n",
    "  - `Interval_Scores` (per-interval stats)\n",
    "  - `Summary_Scores` (aggregated stats)\n",
    "  - `Detailed_Scores` (per-row CRPS and NLL values)\n",
    "  - `Hyperparameters` (model settings)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. **Return DataFrames for Display**\n",
    "- The function returns and displays the four main result DataFrames."
